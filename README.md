<h1>password-manager</h3>
 I used Python and Tkinter to create a password generator app.
 
I expanded on the original project by adding the following functionality:

🌱 Update function

🌱 Check to see if account and email have already been saved

🌱 Ask user if they would like to update

🌱 Allow user to update password from GUI 

🌱 Add a clear function if len(generate_password) not == 0 

🌱 Extend the functionality of the search button to include email
