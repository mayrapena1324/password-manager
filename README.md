# password-manager
 I used Python and Tkinter to create a password generator app.
 
I expanded on the original project by adding the following functionality:

-update function

-check to see if account and email have already been saved

-Ask user if they would like to update

-Allow user to update password from GUI 

-Add a clear function if len(generate_password) not == 0 

-Extend the functionality of the search button to include email
